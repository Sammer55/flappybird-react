# FlappyBird

## Overview

FlappyBird is a project created to test the speed of Vite, practice programming logic, and provide a customizable Flappy Bird game experience. The game allows you to tweak various variables such as bird speed, gravity, pipe sizes, spacing between pipes, and more.

You can easily customize the game variables by navigating to **utils** -> **game.ts** or **bird.ts** (for bird-specific properties like size, jump distance, and duration).
